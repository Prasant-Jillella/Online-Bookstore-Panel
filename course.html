   In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to 
   a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, 
   which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.Physically, a mouse consists of 
   an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. Mice often also feature other elements,
   such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.
