   <p class="fi">
     In computing, a keyboard is a typewriter-style device, which uses an arrangement of buttons
     or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch 
     cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device 
     for computers.

     A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key 
     typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires 
     pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys 
     produce letters, numbers or signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can 
     produce actions or execute computer commands.

   <img src="H:\DS_programs\Html@prasant\Html@Lab\mouse.jpg" height=100 width=200>
   <p class="second">
     In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to 
     a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, 
     which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.Physically, a mouse consists of 
     an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons. Mice often also feature other elements,
     such as touch surfaces and "wheels", which enable additional control and dimensional input.

   <img src="H:\DS_programs\Html@prasant\Html@Lab\cddrive.jpg" height=100 width=100>
   <p class="fi">
     In computing, an optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or 
     electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process 
     of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from 
     discs, but recent drives are commonly both readers and recorders, also called burners 
     or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media 
     which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical drive is the generic name; 
     drives are usually described as "CD" "DVD", or "Blu-ray", followed by "drive", "writer", etc.

  <h1 class="re" id="mo"><u>Monitor</u></h1>
   <img src="H:\DS_programs\Html@prasant\Html@Lab\monitor.jpg" height=100 width=200>
    <p class="second">
     A monitor or a display is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises 
     the display device, circuitry and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is 
     typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) thin panel, while older 
     monitors used a cathode ray tube (CRT) about as deep as the screen size.

     Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers 
     were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have 
     been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented 
     some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and then computer 
     monitors, has also changed from 4:3 to 16:9.
  <h1 class="re" id="p"><u>Printer</u></h1>
   <img src="H:\DS_programs\Html@prasant\Html@Lab\printer.jpg" height=100 width=100>
   <p class="fi">
     In computing, a printer is a peripheral which makes a persistent human-readable representation 
     of graphics or text on paper or similar physical media. The two most common printer mechanisms 
     are black and white laser printers used for common documents, and color ink jet printers which 
     can produce high-quality photograph-quality output.

     The world's first computer printer was a 19th-century mechanically driven apparatus invented by 
     Charles Babbage for his difference engine.[1] This system used a series of metal rods with 
     characters printed on them and stuck a roll of paper against the rods to print the characters. 
     The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype 
     machines, which operated in a similar fashion. The demand for higher speed led to the development
     of new systems specifically for computer use. Among the systems widely used through the 1980s 
     were daisy wheel systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but 
     at much higher speed, and dot matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively 
     low-quality output. The plotter was used for those requiring high-quality line art like blueprints.

  <h1 class="re" id="s"><u>Speaker</u></h1>
   <img src="H:\DS_programs\Html@prasant\Html@Lab\speakers.jpg" height=110 width=110>
   <p class="second">
     Computer speakers, or multimedia speakers, are speakers external to a computer, that disable 
     the lower fidelity built-in speaker. They often have a low-power internal amplifier. 
     The standard audio connection is a 3.5 mm (approximately 1/8 inch) stereo phone connector often 
     color-coded lime green (following the PC 99 standard) for computer sound cards. 
     A few use a RCA connector for input. There are also USB speakers which are powered from the 
     5 volts at 500 milliamps provided by the USB port, allowing about 2.5 watts of output power. 
     Computer speakers were introduced by Altec Lansing in 1990.[1]

     Computer speakers range widely in quality and in price. The computer speakers typically 
     packaged with computer systems are small, plastic, and have mediocre sound quality. 
     Some computer speakers have equalization features such as bass and treble controls.
